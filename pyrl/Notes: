Notes:

Examples are good!

I like the explanation of context... very clear!

The simple 1., 2., 3. was very helpful to understand

YOu don't need to say 'arbitrary features on this'--- it was clear

Prior work section:
		- Might be helpful to tell us why we are going over this set of papers


Shift reduce parser:
	- If we all should have seen it, don't explain it
	- If you're going to explain it, ...


	- I'm not sure what you expect people to understand

Write down the # of examples


Tell me the results you want me to see


Tell me why it's cool you can parse those


Overall:
	Still need a bit better outlining... tell me when you're shifting sections
		- tell me what you're going to tell me
