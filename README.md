# Curriculum-Based Reinforcement Learning

## Project Goal

**High-Level Goal.** Our aim is to devise an agent intrinsically motivated to learn. If the current task is too easy, the agent gets bored; if too hard, it falls into frustration. By maximizing improvement, the agent explores the task space more efficiently and leverages easier task to achieve the learning of a harder one. In other words, we do curriculum learning without explicitly giving a curriculum.
